# tripXP REST API

**Production API:** <https://travelplannerapi-production.up.railway.app/>

**Description:** The REST API for tripXP is implemented via NodeJS with the help of the Express.js framework.

## Development

- Make sure that you're within the `backend` directory when working on the API.
- Make sure that you create a local `.env` file and configure it to your needs‚ùó You will need to create one when you first clone the repo. A sample is provided as `.env.sample`
  - See the group discord's [#secrets](https://discordapp.com/channels/1225842180912971926/1230529347765538877) channel if you need the secret variables for your local `.env`
- No special tooling is required at this time. `npm intall` will install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as a dev dependency. nodemon is useful for automatically restarting the node application any time that a file changes in the directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:alclary/travelplanner.git
cd travelplanner/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment and Production

- When a pull request is accepted into the main branch (requires code review), Github Actions will coordinate with Railway and attempt to automatically deploy the latest code to the production URL shared above.
  - If the PR only contains backend changes, then only the backend should be rebuilt and redeployed in Railway.
- If the Railway build and deployment fails to build and serve the nodeJS app, both Github and Railway _should_ announce the failure. Please see either the [#railway](https://discordapp.com/channels/1225842180912971926/1230325947404652584) channel in our group discord server or log in to the Railway dashboard itself to view more details on any failure.
- Production handles its own [set of environmental variables](https://docs.railway.app/guides/variables), navigate to the Railway dashboard to view and configure those.

## Using the API

### JWT Authentication and Authorization
- Bearer Token Authorization via a valid JWT in the Authorization header is required for endpoints listed below. The JWT must be valid and issued by Google Identity Services (i.e. Google Sign On). 
  - All /trip endpoints
  - All /user endpoints

### Experiences

#### Create a new Experience

- To create a new Experience, send a POST request using the path '/experience'.
- No parameters are required.
- The body of the request should include the following:
  - title: STRING - Cannot be NULL
  - description: STRING - Cannot be NULL
  - latitude: REAL - Cannot be NULL
  - longitude: REAL - Cannot be NULL
  - image_url: STRING
  - rating: REAL - Cannot be NULL
  - location: STRING
  - keywords: JSON
  - user_id: INTEGER
- The Primary Key id will be created automatically
- Timestamps will be added automatically to the createdAt and updatedAt fields
- A 200 status code, status bool, and success message will be returned upon successful creation.
- A 400 status code, status bool, and failure message are returned if the body of the request is empty.
- A 500 status code, status bool, and error message is returned upon error.

##### EXAMPLE - Request body

```json
{
  "title": "Test Experience 3",
  "description": "Yet another sentence describing the experience.",
  "latitude": 12.789,
  "longitude": -23.7654,
  "image_url": "/path/to/image3.jpg",

  "user_id": 2
}
```

##### EXAMPLE - Response

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": "Successfully created new experience."
}
```

#### Read All Existing Experience Matching Parameters

- To read Experiences, send a GET request using the path '/experience'.
- The provided parameters will be used to generate an SQL query and all
  Experiences matching the query will be returned.
- This means, for instance, that providing a User ID as a parameter will
  return all the Experiences created by that user.
- A request with no parameters will return all Experiences.
- A 200 status code, status bool, and the retrieved data will be returned upon success.
- A 500 status code, status bool, and error message is returned upon error.
